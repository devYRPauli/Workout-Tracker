We (Samarth and Yash) together are working on an app that will revolutionize the way people see fitness and health. It all seems very difficult for everyone to stay on the right track and maintain their healthy lifestyle but with “TATV” that will change. We will make fitness feasible for everyone. Our app will take in your age, weight, height, and some other data to best estimate your current condition of fitness and will further guide you towards being the best version of yourself. We will have a food calorie tracker in-built, Yoga Videos from your favorite creators from YouTube, Gym Locations, Nutrition charts, Diet charts, and further exercises for your weekly split. We will also have a weekly and monthly leaderboard so you can compete with your friends and family in terms of who completed the most number of goals daily.
